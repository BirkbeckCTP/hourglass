          for allowing us to build on her brilliant work to raise awareness of
          our journal flipping scheme and help unlock global access to
          humanities scholarship.</p>

          <p>The seventh poster in our series was designed by Nicky Borowiec to
          celebrate Open Access Week 2023 (and its proximity to Halloween). The
          Zombie Poster commemorates the term ‘zombie journal’, first used by
          linguists in 2015 following the mass resignation of editors at the
          Elsevier journal <i>Lingua</i>. Protesting Elsevier’s claim to ‘own’ their
          journal, the international linguistics community boycotted <i>Lingua</i> and
          launched the community-owned open access journal <i>Glossa</i> in its place
          (published by the OLH). What was left behind was dubbed ‘Zombie
          Lingua’. With the commission of this original artwork, we celebrate
          the spirit that made this political action possible and preserve it
          for the public record.</p>
