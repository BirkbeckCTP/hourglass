        <h3>Research published by Open Library of Humanities makes headline news appearance</h3>
        <p>Research published by OLH features on the home page of <i>The Guardian</i>. The showcased article, ‘You have to keep track of your changes': The Version Variants and Publishing History of David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas' by Professor Martin Paul Eve, examines the version variants of the wildly popular novel and the publishing processes that caused it. The article is notable for using a set of custom software tools to visualise the version variants and reordering of the text. The piece, which was, of course, open access, released its software, data, and concordance files under open licenses. </p>
