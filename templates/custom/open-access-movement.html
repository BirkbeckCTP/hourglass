        <p>Our work at the OLH builds on decades of internet activism. Since the availability of public internet in the 1990s, scientists have been self-archiving their work to provide access to scholarly research. The dream of unrestricted online access to scholarly journal articles, which became known as the open access movement, took shape in the early 2000s as scholars, librarians, and funders began to build co-operative networks and platforms.</p>

        <h2>‘Serials crisis’</h2>
        <p class="font-semibold">The open access movement emerged against the backdrop of what is referred to as ‘the serials crisis’ in scholarly publishing. Since the 1970s, the number of published academic journals has rapidly increased — beyond the capacity of small-scale university presses. As universities outsourced the publishing of their work to commercial publishing companies, who became more wealthy and powerful in the process, journal subscription packages (known as serials) began to cripple university library budgets.</p>
        <p>Libraries could no longer afford to subscribe to the journals their own scholars had set up, despite much of the labour of writing, peer reviewing, and editing these articles being done on a voluntary basis by the academics themselves. Meanwhile, the profit margins of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502#pone-0127502-g007">publishing giants grew</a> beyond those of oil companies and in line with the world's most profitable drug, Pfizer. This has been made possible by appropriating public funds from universities. Elsevier, for example, recorded <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science">profits of more than 40%</a> in 2012 and 2013, which is higher than Apple, Google and Amazon.</p>
        <p>Open access (OA) has the potential to disrupt this commercial model. If scholarly journals are freely available on the public internet for anyone to read, publishers lose their subscription income. In reaction, and to meet public demand for open access, commercial publishers have shifted the cost of publishing back onto academic authors. In effect, what has emerged is an open access pay-to-publish model.</p>
        <p>This has profoundly anti-democratic consequences, which disadvantages scholars in the Global South, precarious scholars, and scholars working in disciplines that are under-funded (which affects the humanities, in particular).</p>

        <h2>What is diamond open access?</h2>
        <p class="font-semibold">The costs of open access publication need to be paid for somehow. The best-known routes to achieving this are ‘gold’ and ‘green’ OA. Both models can be problematic.</p>
        <p>‘Gold’ open access makes articles available immediately on publication, without paywalls. However, publishing companies derive profits by shifting costs to authors or institutions through article processing charges (APCs). The problem: this is still a corporate model of publication and, with government pushing for this model of open access, it easily aligns with wider fears about the neoliberalisation of universities. This can end up shaping the debate about open access, and the community-driven history of the movement risks being defined out of existence.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, ‘green’ open access refers to authors publishing in traditional, paywall journals but then self-archiving their work to make it publicly available. The problem: access is often delayed because of an embargo set at the request of the publisher, which means they continue to profit because paid subscriptions continue to be necessary.</p>
        <p>Unlike ‘green’ or ‘gold’ models, ‘diamond’ open access has the potential to meaningfully disrupt the profit margins of commercial publishers. With diamond open access, non-commercial, not-for-profit organisations and community networks make material available free of charge to both authors and readers. In our diamond model, fair support from a large pool of scholarly institutions means that we can operate sustainably and without the need for voluntary academic labour.</p>
        <p>With government mandates, many humanities academics feel that they are having ‘openness violently thrust upon them’; diamond open access, OLH co-founder <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/mar/25/open-access-humanities-future">Martin Paul Eve reasons</a>, is a means for academics to ‘re-seize some limited agency’ and shape the direction of scholarly publishing. Rather than ‘have things solely done to us’, it allows us to be ‘active participants’ in our own destinies and those of our scholarly communities.</p>

          <h2>The story of open access.</h2>
          <p class="font-semibold">What follows is a timeline of the history of open access. It is a story of rampant commercialisation of higher education in the UK, US, Europe, and across the globe.</p>
          <p>It is also a story of the passionate individuals who stood up for their academic communities and refused to allow global corporate publishing giants to cripple academic scholarship. From high-profile academic boycotts of notorious publishers to the creation of collaborative open-source digital platforms and tools, this is the story of the individuals who chose to stand up to big business in the political struggle for open access to scholarly knowledge.</p>

            <p>The Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) launches in Brazil to provide a bibliographic database, digital library, and electronic publishing model of open access journals. There are currently 14 countries in <a href="https://www.scielo.org/">the SciELO network</a> and its journal collections: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela.</p>
            <p>The Association of Research Libraries establishes the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), an alliance of academic and research libraries and other organizations, to address the ‘serials crisis’ in academic publishing and develop and promote open access.</p>

            <p>BioMed Central, the self-described first and largest OA science publisher and PubMed Central, a free digital repository for biomedical and life sciences journal, is founded. In 2008, Springer announces the acquisition of BioMed Central, making it, in effect, the world’s largest open access publisher.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> (PLOS) launches as a not-for-profit publisher of open-access journals in science, technology, and medicine. The movement starts with an online petition co-authored by Harold Varmus, Nobel Prize winner and Director of the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Patrick O. Brown, a biochemist at Stanford University, and Michael Eisen, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley. In a groundswell of political solidarity, academics and librarians worked together, using a petition to call for scientists to pledge that they would only submit their research articles to open access journals, effectively boycotting established journals in their academic fields.</p>

            <p>The UK Government commissions <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/publish/finch/">The Finch Report</a>, which recommends that open access should be mandatory for projects funded by the UK Research Councils, including the AHRC. The Finch Report recommends publishers adopt article processing charges (APCs) to fund the transition to open access. Scholarly and learned societies protest that their members cannot afford <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jul/17/open-access-scientific-research">average APCs of £1500 to £2000</a> (about $2000 to $3000).</p>
            <p>British mathematician Timothy Gowers (University of Cambridge) calls for a boycott of Elsevier with a post on his personal blog. Gowers’ statement kickstarts ‘<a href="https://gowers.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/elsevierstatementfinal.pdf">The Cost of Knowledge</a>’, an academic-led movement that quickly gains widespread academic and media coverage. As the mission statement explains: “Elsevier, Springer, and a number of other commercial publishers (many of them large companies but less significant for their mathematics publishing, e.g., Wiley) all exploit our volunteer labor to extract very large profits from the academic community. They supply some value in the process, but nothing like enough to justify their prices.”</p>
            <p>Harvard University Library, one of the world’s wealthiest libraries, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices">sends a memo</a> to the university’s 2,100 teaching and research staff warning that it could no longer afford the price hikes imposed by many large journal publishers, which bill the library around $3.5m a year. Exasperated by rising subscription costs, Harvard University encourages its faculty to publish their research in open access journals and to resign from publications that keep articles behind paywalls.</p>

            <p>The Open Library of Humanities (OLH) launches as a diamond open access publisher with 7 journals, funded by its Library Partnership Subsidy (LPS) scheme – a membership network of university libraries. Housed at Birkbeck, University of London, the OLH is awarded a three-year grant of $741,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to build a sustainable model for open-access publishing in the humanities. The OLH initially uses a digital publishing platform provided by Ubiquity Press from 2015 until 2018, when it launches its own in-house platform called Janeway (see below).</p>
            <p>The entire editorial board of Elsevier’s flagship linguistics journal <em>Lingua</em> resign their positions and start up a new diamond open access journal called <em>Glossa</em>, published by the Open Library of Humanities. As<i> Glossa</i>’s Editor-in-Chief Johan Rooryck (who went on to become Director of Plan S) writes in the <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/4812/">Editorial Introduction</a> to the first issue published in 2015: ‘we have been able to flip our journal from subscription to Open Access in about four months. In this way, we provide proof of concept that it is possible to quickly and seamlessly move an entire editorial team, its editorial board, its authors and its readers to a new publishing platform’.</p>
            <p>As the owner of the journal title for <em>Lingua</em>, Elsevier continues running the journal with a new editorial board. Prominent linguistics scholars organise a <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/background/glossa-how-a-journal-took-matters-into-their-own-hands-to-make-research-available">boycott of <i>Lingua</i></a>, calling it ‘Zombie <em>Lingua</em>’ on social media and refusing to publish or review for the old journal.</p>

            <p>Science Europe, COAlition S, OPERAS, and the French National Research Agency (ANR) launches an Action Plan for Diamond Open Access. The initiative works towards a scholarly publishing infrastructure that is equitable, community-driven, and academic-led and owned, to enable the global research community to take charge of a scholarly communication system by and for research communities. It focuses on efficiency, quality standards, capacity building, and sustainability, and it addresses the alignment and development of common resources for the whole Diamond OA ecosystem, including journals and platforms, while respecting the cultural, multilingual, and disciplinary diversity that constitutes the strength of the sector. Since its launch, the Action Plan has been endorsed by hundreds of organisations and individuals (including the Open Library of Humanities).</p>
