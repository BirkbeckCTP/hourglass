            <p>As a publisher, having our own interdisciplinary journal means we
            can showcase best practice. <i>OLHJ</i> was inspired by experiments
            with open access in the sciences around the turn of the millennium,
            which we adapted to suit humanities scholarship. The journal offers a
            home for curated Special Collections of articles that form a cohesive
            body of research.</p>

          <h2 id="history">History.</h2>
          <p><i>OLHJ</i> was inspired by experiments in digital publishing in the
          early 2000s. Building on the open source movement, scientists innovated
          open research practices as well as crafting new infrastructures to make
          them possible. Megajournals like PLOS ONE aimed to accelerate article
          publication, trial new forms of peer review, and provide coverage of a
          broad range of subject areas.</p>
          <p>Back in 2013, we asked whether these publishing innovations could be
          adapted to humanities scholarship. <i>OLHJ</i> is an evolution of some of
          these concepts, including rolling publication models and expanded
          disciplinary boundaries in favour of a broad readership. It took us two
          years in dialogue with scholars, editors, publishers, funding agencies,
          and software engineers to determine the best way forwards. We facilitated
          public discussions to find the right balance between preserving
          traditional humanities practices of editing and curatorship alongside
          innovative digital publishing methods.</p>
          <p>Scholars agreed that a sciences model required careful consideration
          to support the disciplinary integrity of humanities fields. Using
          <i>OLHJ</i> as an example of best practice, we've worked hard to meet the
          needs and expectations of the humanities community by publishing
          rigorously peer-reviewed articles within field-specific, curated
          collections.</p>
          <p>Most important of all, <i>OLHJ</i> articles are available to anyone
          with an internet connection — without restriction, and with no author or
          reader fees.</p>

          <h2 id="special-collections">Special collections.</h2>
          <p><i>OLHJ</i> publishes articles in curated ‘Special Collections’ —
          guest-edited issues in a specific field, subject, or exploring a
          particular historic or cultural event within the humanities.</p>
          <p>Special Collections combine the best of traditional journals with the
          latest innovations in digital publishing. They retain the focus
          associated with niche humanities disciplines, enabling ongoing dialogue
          between scholars. However, our rolling publication format accelerates
          access to original research because articles are published as soon as
          they successfully pass review.</p>
          <p>This was inspired by the use of preprint servers in the sciences to
          share research findings quickly with the scholarly community. The
          elasticity of our model also means that Collections can remain open for a
          longer period of time, growing organically and inspiring response pieces
          that can appear within the same Collection.</p>
          <blockquote>
            For me, the Special Collection format at the <i>Open Library
            of Humanities</i> journal is an excellent alternative to more
            traditional forms of edited collection, both because of the brilliant
            editorial support that we received from the OLH and also because the
            open rolling format was so generative. Being able to decide how long
            submissions could be kept open meant that the collection developed in
            ways we could never have imagined in advance. The resulting gathering
            of work is genuinely diverse, inspired by our research context and
            questions but not limited by them.

          <p>We think that the level of personalised, customisable, and dedicated
          support we offer is unmatched, whether in the form of video meetings,
          professional copyediting, tailored tech training sessions, instant
          messenger, or mechanisms for using editor feedback to improve our
          in-house submissions platform.</p>
          <p>Our small and friendly editorial team are available during normal
          working hours throughout the year to answer editorial and technology
          queries and take each published article through a thorough in-house
          copyedit before publication. The OLH combines this professionalism with
          our tradition of being proudly academic-led: each member of our editorial
          team is a qualified academic with a PhD in the humanities and therefore
          has personal experience of peer reviewed, academic publishing.</p>
          <blockquote>
            I really enjoyed working with the OLH, and thought their work
            was excellent: just the right amount of editing and always fast, and
            always patient as we tried to navigate the workflow. I’ve worked with a
            lot of publishers and journals by now, and that was the smoothest,
            friendliest and best-value experience I’ve had in the last 15 years. I
            hope to work with them again in the future.
