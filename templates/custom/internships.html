        <p class="lead text-white">As part of our commitment to sustainable working practices in the humanities, we are proud to support the CHASE Doctoral Training Partnership internship placement scheme.</p>
        <p>This scheme is available to CHASE-funded humanities PhD researchers and is a fully paid opportunity to work within the OLH and gain valuable experience in publishing across our editorial, technical and marketing teams.</p>
      {% endfill %}
      {% fill "column_two" %}
        <p>The placement is available for 6 months full time, or equivalent part time for up to 12 months by arrangement. It is fully set up for remote working, and so there is no travel requirement involved. Interns learn about the entire publication process, but the position can also be geared towards the individual’s interests.</p>
        <p>Our interns are valued parts of our team, and we work closely with them to help ensure that they have a well-rounded, enjoyable and interesting time with us, and leave equipped with the skills, knowledge and confidence to help launch their future careers, whether within open access publishing or beyond.</p>

            <p>Our organisation is small and non-hierarchical, which means that our interns get to experience work across editorial, marketing and tech and gain a real sense of how these aspects strategically combine. My favourite thing about working with our interns has been them finding that their perspectives are just as valuable as anybody else’s in the team. Indeed, as an expanding organisation, with big aspirations, we are always critiquing our internal processes, and a pair of fresh eyes is both a privilege and a source of energy.</p>

            <p>Like many people, I got into publishing through an internship at a university press. It was unpaid, which was only feasible because I had no caring responsibilities and I could work another part-time job that just barely paid the bills. I am so glad that OLH interns are compensated through CHASE, providing what I hope is a more equitable career path into mission-driven humanities publishing.</p>

            <p>[The internship has] not only been a great first step into academic publishing, but also an illuminating peep into the politics and the economics of academic research and publications. As a student, I have been taught about the contents of many papers, but no one ever mentioned the machinations that go on behind the scenes […]. Whilst studying at Birkbeck made me a more critical reader, this internship made me look behind the ‘what’ of the content to the ‘why’ of the paper itself.</p>
